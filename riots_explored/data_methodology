Gun violence was tracked using data from the Gun Violence Archive.
The sample periods were the 60 days following George Floyd's murder, compared to the same 60-day period in 2019.
Shootings were plotted by neighborhood via address using this app: https://cityoflakes.maps.arcgis.com/apps/PublicGallery/map.html?appid=4172cd1ed97749a6a4623dd7aa5a246f&webmap=687b83365dd34e48b759ce3121ff4497
If a gun violence incident happened entirely within one neighborhood, it was recorded as one full incident in that neighborhood in the data file.
If it happened at the intersection of two neighborhoods, it was recorded as one half-incident for both neighborhoods in the data file.
If it happened at the intersection of four neighborhoods, it was recorded as one quarter-incident for all four neighborhoods in the data file.
This method was used to prevent any YOY change in gun violence being recorded between time periods purely from shootings happening at neighborhood intersections.
Data on severity of rioting in Minneapolis by neighborhood was gathered using a catalogue of buildings damaged or destroyed in the first week following Floyd's murder here: https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/a-list-of-the-buildings-damaged-looted-in-minneapolis-and-st-paul
R was used to model the relationship between number of buildings damaged or destroyed, and the increase or decrease in gun violence between the 2019 and 2020 time periods.
